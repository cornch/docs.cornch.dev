# About this site

> I'm too lazy to write a English version of about page. So this page is translated by GitHub Copilot. Except this blockquote.

Hi! I'm Cornch, the author of this site.  
First of all, thank you for visiting this site. I spent a lot of time on this site, I hope you can benefit from it.
If you have any suggestions for this site, you can submit an issue on [GitHub Repository](https://github.
com/cornch/docs.cornch.dev). Or, you can join [my Discord Server](https://discord.gg/MNFRMG4SdJ) to contact me.

By the way, if you think this site is good, I hope you can help me spread it, so that more people know about this site.

I will answer some questions that you may want to know below.

## What is this site?

This is a website that stores the Mandarin (Taiwan) translation of the Laravel document. It will be updated continuously.

## Why do I make this site?

I found that many people are afraid to read English documents when I answer questions about Laravel on the Internet. Most of the existing Chinese translations are old (< Laravel 6.x), or they are Chinese simplified translations.
I encourage everyone to read English documents more, but I know that there are still people whose English level does not allow it, so this site provides a language switch function, so that everyone can read it side by side.
So, I made my own translation. Most of the translations are translated by me in my spare time.

## Where do these translations come from?

These translations are translated by me in my spare time, and will be updated continuously.
The translation process is directly translated from the English original text to Mandarin (Taiwan), and the translation will not refer to any other version of the translation.

## Your translation is weird

I'm not a professional translator, so there may be some strange places when I translate. If you have any suggestions,
you are welcome to submit them on [GitHub](https://github.com/cornch/laravel-docs-l10n).

## Why are there small Chinese characters above some English?

In some some situation, I choose to not translate some work into Chinese:

- The word is often referred by English in the community, and it is more fluent to use English instead of Chinese.
- The word will be used in the code, such as Notification or Model.

In these two situations, I will choose to keep the original word. However, not everyone can understand the meaning of these words, so I will mark the Chinese translation of these words above these words, so that people who don't understand English can understand the meaning of these words.

If you don't like to see these small Chinese characters, you can consider hiding the `<ruby>` tag with a browser extension. Or wait until I have time to update the site to add a function to hide these small Chinese characters.

## Why there is no search function?

I haven't done it yet. If you are interested, you can help me do one.

## License?

All Laravel documents are released under the MIT license, so these translations are also released under the MIT license.
This site's source code, as you can see in the footer, is released under the AGPL-v3 license.
